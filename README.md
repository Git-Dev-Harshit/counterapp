# React + Vite

This is my first react app which is basically a counter application where I used "useState" hook to set the value of counter after updation and reflecting the same on UI.

The value of counter adds by 1 when click on "Add Value" button and decrease by 1 when click on "Remove Value". I have also added a condition to check the current value of counter before updating it to new one i.e., counter value cannot be less than 0 and greater than 20.
